This is my first simple jetpack compose application, but still using many activity (still under
development)

for the next development I hope, I can create it based on navigation to reduce using activity, and
also implement Dependency Injection (maybe using [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/))

Feature I use:

1. Kotlin Flow
2. Gson for parsing Retrofit and Shared Preferences
3. Retrofit
4. *JETPACK COMPOSE*

For the API, I got the API from [here](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

Thank you for dropping by :)
